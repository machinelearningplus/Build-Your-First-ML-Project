# Build-Your-First-ML-Project

This repository contains the notebooks and datasets to run the code in ['Build your first ML Project'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSsjPbowHQ0&list=PLFAYD0dt5xCymcvacfR4CLB9Pk_9L50gz) series.

Just download or clone the repo and run it. You might have to update the path to the dataset inside the notebooks. 

## How to run the code / notebook in Google colab?
To run the notebook in Google colab, change the notebook url text from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com', it will reload the entire notebook to google colab.

Then, you need to update the dataset path inside the colab notebook by one of the two methods:
1. Upload the dataset to google colab and update the path.
   Or
2. Update the links for 'Churn_Modeling.csv' to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machinelearningplus/Build-Your-First-ML-Project/main/00_Datasets/Churn_Modelling.csv) and 'Churn_Modeling_m.csv' to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machinelearningplus/Build-Your-First-ML-Project/main/00_Datasets/Churn_Modelling_m.csv).
